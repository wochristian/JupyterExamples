    "Dan decided to build a simulation for the collision of two identical (in radius and mass) billiard balls.  He assumes that the balls move at fixed velocity on the table (between collisions), and that during the collision a fixed force acts between them.  In the right part of Figure 7 (\"Observation\"), Dan sketched the trajectory of the balls before, during, and after the collision.\n",
